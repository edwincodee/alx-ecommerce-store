# ALX E-Commerce Store

An interactive **frontend e-commerce web application** built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript** and **TailwindCSS**. The project demonstrates a simple online shopping experience where users can browse products, view details, add items to a cart, and proceed to a dummy checkout.

This project was developed as part of my **ALX ProDev Frontend Program Final Project**.
